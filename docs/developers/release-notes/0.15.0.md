# 0.15.0

## Highlights

### Sorting

#### Frecency Sorting (Enabled by Default)

Results are now sorted using frecency - a ranking algorithm that combines **frequency** (how often you select an item) and **recency** (how recently you selected it). The more you use tv, the better it gets at predicting what you're looking for.

This is enabled by default and works automatically across all channels. Items you select frequently and recently will appear higher in results, even with partial or fuzzy matches. This can be opted out on a per-channel basis.

#### Preserve Original Order

For cases where you want to preserve the original order from the source command (e.g., pre-sorted output, chronological logs), use the new `--no-sort` flag:

```sh
tv --source-command "git log --oneline" --no-sort
```

This disables both match-quality sorting and frecency, displaying results in the exact order provided by the source.

### Action Picker

A new action picker lets you browse and execute available actions for the current entry. Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd> to open it.

### UI Improvements

- **Cycle indicators**: When source or preview cycling is enabled, a tab indicator shows which command is active
- **Keybinding hints**: The UI now shows hints for cycling keybindings when available
- **Preview word wrap**: Enable with `--preview-word-wrap`

### Channel Enhancements

- **Custom shell**: Channels can now specify a custom shell for source, preview, and action commands
- **Missing requirements popup**: The remote control now shows a popup when a channel has unmet requirements
- **21 new community channels** added
- **Improved default actions** for existing channels

### Other Changes

- `--input-position` CLI argument to control input bar placement
- `list-channels` output is now sorted alphabetically
- `update-channels` skips channels with unmet requirements by default
- Braille Unicode character support in preview
- Various bug fixes and performance improvements
