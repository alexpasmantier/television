.SH DESCRIPTION
A cross\-platform, fast and extensible general purpose fuzzy finder TUI.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-\-preview\-offset\fR=\fISTRING\fR
A preview line number offset template to use to scroll the preview to for each
entry.

This template uses the same syntax as the `preview` option and will be formatted
using the currently selected entry.
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-preview\fR
Disable the preview panel entirely on startup.
.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-tick\-rate\fR=\fIFLOAT\fR
The application\*(Aqs tick rate.

The tick rate is the number of times the application will update per
second. This can be used to control responsiveness and CPU usage on
very slow machines or very fast ones but the default should be a good
compromise for most users.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-frame\-rate\fR=\fIFLOAT\fR
[DEPRECATED] Frame rate, i.e. number of frames to render per second.

This option is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
.TP
\fB\-k\fR, \fB\-\-keybindings\fR=\fISTRING\fR
Keybindings to override the default keybindings.

This can be used to override the default keybindings with a custom subset
The keybindings are specified as a semicolon separated list of keybinding
expressions using the configuration file formalism.

Example: `tv \-\-keybindings=\*(Aqquit="esc";select_next_entry=["down","ctrl\-j"]\*(Aq`
.TP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-input\fR=\fISTRING\fR
Input text to pass to the channel to prefill the prompt.

This can be used to provide a default value for the prompt upon
startup.
.TP
\fB\-\-input\-header\fR=\fISTRING\fR
Input field header template.

The given value is parsed as a `MultiTemplate`. It is evaluated against
the current channel name and the resulting text is shown as the input
field title. Defaults to the current channel name when omitted.
.TP
\fB\-\-preview\-header\fR=\fISTRING\fR
Preview header template

The given value is parsed as a `MultiTemplate`. It is evaluated for every
entry and its result is displayed above the preview panel.
.TP
\fB\-\-preview\-footer\fR=\fISTRING\fR
Preview footer template

The given value is parsed as a `MultiTemplate`. It is evaluated for every
entry and its result is displayed below the preview panel.
.TP
\fB\-\-source\-command\fR=\fISTRING\fR
Source command to use for the current channel.

This overrides the command defined in the channel prototype.
Example: `find . \-name \*(Aq*.rs\*(Aq`
.TP
\fB\-\-source\-display\fR=\fISTRING\fR
Source display template to use for the current channel.

This overrides the display template defined in the channel prototype.
The template is used to format each entry in the results list.
Example: `{split:/:\-1}` (show only the last path segment)
.TP
\fB\-\-source\-output\fR=\fISTRING\fR
Source output template to use for the current channel.

This overrides the output template defined in the channel prototype.
The template is used to format the final output when an entry is selected.
Example: "{}" (output the full entry)
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-preview\-command\fR=\fISTRING\fR
Preview command to use for the current channel.

This overrides the preview command defined in the channel prototype.
Example: "cat {}" (where {} will be replaced with the entry)

Parts of the entry can be extracted positionally using the `delimiter`
option.
Example: "echo {0} {1}" will split the entry by the delimiter and pass
the first two fields to the command.
.TP
\fB\-\-layout\fR=\fISTRING\fR
Layout orientation for the UI.

This overrides the layout/orientation defined in the channel prototype.
Options are "landscape" or "portrait".
.TP
\fB\-\-autocomplete\-prompt\fR=\fISTRING\fR
Try to guess the channel from the provided input prompt.

This can be used to automatically select a channel based on the input
prompt by using the `shell_integration` mapping in the configuration
file.
.TP
\fB\-\-exact\fR
Use substring matching instead of fuzzy matching.

This will use substring matching instead of fuzzy matching when
searching for entries. This is useful when the user wants to search for
an exact match instead of a fuzzy match e.g. to improve performance.
.TP
\fB\-\-select\-1\fR
Automatically select and output the first entry if there is only one
entry.

Note that most channels stream entries asynchronously which means that
knowing if there\*(Aqs only one entry will require waiting for the channel
to finish loading first.

For most channels and workloads this shouldn\*(Aqt be a problem since the
loading times are usually very short and will go unnoticed by the user.
.TP
\fB\-\-take\-1\fR
Take the first entry from the list after the channel has finished loading.

This will wait for the channel to finish loading all entries and then
automatically select and output the first entry. Unlike `select_1`, this
will always take the first entry regardless of how many entries are available.
.TP
\fB\-\-take\-1\-fast\fR
Take the first entry from the list as soon as it becomes available.

This will immediately select and output the first entry as soon as it
appears in the results, without waiting for the channel to finish loading.
This is the fastest option when you just want the first result.
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-remote\fR
Disable the remote control.

This will disable the remote control panel and associated actions
entirely. This is useful when the remote control is not needed or
when the user wants `tv` to run in single\-channel mode (e.g. when
using it as a file picker for a script or embedding it in a larger
application).
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-help\fR
Disable the help panel.

This will disable the help panel and associated toggling actions
entirely. This is useful when the help panel is not needed or
when the user wants `tv` to run with a minimal interface (e.g. when
using it as a file picker for a script or embedding it in a larger
application).
.TP
\fB\-\-ui\-scale\fR=\fIINTEGER\fR [default: 100]
Change the display size in relation to the available area.

This will crop the UI to a centered rectangle of the specified
percentage of the available area (e.g. 0.5 for 50% x 50%).
.TP
\fB\-\-preview\-size\fR=\fIINTEGER\fR
Percentage of the screen to allocate to the preview panel (1\-99).

This value overrides any `preview_size` defined in configuration files or channel prototypes.
.TP
\fB\-\-config\-file\fR=\fIPATH\fR
Provide a custom configuration file to use.
.TP
\fB\-\-cable\-dir\fR=\fIPATH\fR
Provide a custom cable directory to use.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Print help (see a summary with \*(Aq\-h\*(Aq)
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Print version
.TP
[\fICHANNEL\fR]
Which channel shall we watch?

A list of the available channels can be displayed using the
`list\-channels` command. The channel can also be changed from within
the application.
.TP
[\fIPATH\fR]
The working directory to start the application in.

This can be used to specify a different working directory for the
application to start in. This is useful when the application is
started from a different directory than the one the user wants to
interact with.
