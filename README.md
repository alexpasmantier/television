## About
`Television` is a fast and versatile fuzzy finder TUI.

It lets you quickly search through any kind of data source (files, git repositories, environment variables, docker
images, you name it) using a fuzzy matching algorithm and is designed to be easily extensible.


It is inspired by the neovim [telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) plugin and leverages [tokio](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio) and the *nucleo* matcher used by the [helix](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix) editor to ensure optimal performance.


## Features
- ‚ö°Ô∏è **High Speed**: asynchronous I/O and multithreading to ensure a smooth and responsive UI.

- üß† **Fuzzy Matching**: cutting-edge fuzzy matching library for efficiently filtering through lists of entries.

- üîã **Batteries Included**: comes with a set of builtin channels and previewers that you can start using out of the box.

- üêö **Shell Integration**: benefit from smart completion anywhere using `television`'s shell integration.

- üì∫ **Channels**: designed around the concept of channels, which are a set of builtin data sources that you can search through (e.g. files, git repositories, environment variables, etc).

- üì° **Cable Channels**: users may add their own custom channels to tv using a simple and centralized configuration file.

- üìú **Previewers**: allows you to preview the contents of an entry in a separate pane.

- üñºÔ∏è **Builtin Syntax Highlighting**: comes with builtin asynchronous syntax highlighting for a wide variety of file types.

- üéõÔ∏è **Keybindings**: includes a set of intuitive default keybindings inspired by vim and other popular terminal shortcuts.

- üåà **Themes**: either use one of the 10 builtin themes or create your own easily.

- üì¶ **Cross-platform**: works on Linux, MacOS and Windows.

- ‚úÖ **Terminal Emulator Compatibility**: television works flawlessly on all major terminal emulators.


## Installation
See the [installation docs](https://github.com/alexpasmantier/television/wiki/Installation).


## Usage
```bash
tv [channel] #[default: files] [possible values: env, files, git-repos, text, alias]

# e.g. to search through environment variables
tv env

# piping into tv (e.g. logs)
my_program | tv

# piping into tv with a custom preview command
fd -t f . | tv --preview 'bat -n --color=always {0}'

```
*For more information on the different channels, see the [channels](./docs/channels.md) documentation.*

Television can also integrate with your shell to provide autocompletion based on the commands you start typing. See [Shell Autocompletion](https://github.com/alexpasmantier/television/wiki/Shell-Autocomletion).

## Keybindings
Default keybindings are as follows:

| Key | Description |
| :---: | ----------- |
| <kbd>‚Üë</kbd> / <kbd>‚Üì</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>p</kbd> / <kbd>n</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>k</kbd> / <kbd>j</kbd> | Navigate through the list of entries |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>u</kbd> / <kbd>d</kbd> | Scroll the preview pane up / down |
| <kbd>Enter</kbd> | Select the current entry |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>y</kbd> | Copy the selected entry to the clipboard |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>r</kbd> | Toggle remote control mode |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>s</kbd> | Toggle send to channel mode |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>g</kbd> | Toggle the help panel |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>o</kbd> | Toggle the preview panel |
| <kbd>Esc</kbd> | Quit the application |

These keybindings are all configurable (see [Configuration](#configuration)).


## Configuration

**Default configuration: [config.toml](./.config/config.toml)**

Locations where `television` expects the configuration files to be located for each platform:

|Platform|Value|
|--------|:-----:|
|Linux|`$HOME/.config/television/config.toml`|
|macOS|`$HOME/.config/television/config.toml`|
|Windows|`{FOLDERID_LocalAppData}\television\config`|

Or, if you'd rather use the XDG Base Directory Specification, tv will look for the configuration file in
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/television/config.toml` if the environment variable is set.

## Themes
Builtin themes are available in the [themes](./themes) directory. Feel free to experiment and maybe even contribute your own!

| ![catppuccin](./assets/catppuccin.png "catppuccin") catppuccin | ![gruvbox](./assets/gruvbox.png "gruvbox") gruvbox-dark |
|:--:|:--:|
| ![solarized-dark](./assets/solarized-dark.png "gruvbox-light") **solarized-dark** | ![nord](./assets/nord.png "nord") **nord** |

You may create your own custom themes by adding them to the `themes` directory in your configuration folder and then referring to them by file name (without the extension) in the configuration file.
```
config_location/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ themes/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ my_theme.toml
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ config.toml
```

## Search Patterns
`television` uses a fuzzy matching algorithm to filter the list of entries. Its behavior depends on the input pattern you provide.

| Matcher | Pattern |
| --- | :---: |
| Fuzzy | `foo` |
| Substring | `'foo` / `!foo` to negate |
| Prefix | `^foo` / `!^foo` to negate |
| Suffix | `foo$` / `!foo$` to negate |
| Exact | `^foo$` / `!^foo$` to negate |

For more information on the matcher behavior, see the
[nucleo-matcher](https://docs.rs/nucleo-matcher/latest/nucleo_matcher/pattern/enum.AtomKind.html) documentation.

## Credits
This project was inspired by the **awesome** work done by the [telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) neovim plugin.

It also leverages the great [helix](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix) editor's nucleo fuzzy matching library, the [tokio](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio) async runtime as well as the **formidable** [ratatui](https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui) library.
