/// # Channel Mode (when `channel` is specified)
/// In this mode, the specified channel provides base configuration (source commands,
/// preview commands, UI settings, etc.) and CLI flags act as **overrides** to those defaults.
/// This mode is more permissive and allows any combination of flags since they override
/// sensible channel defaults.
///
/// # Ad-hoc Mode (when `channel` is not specified)
/// In this mode, the CLI creates a custom channel on-the-fly based on the provided flags.
/// This mode has **stricter validation** to ensure the resulting channel is functional:
/// - Source-related flags (`--source-display`, `--source-output`) require `--source-command`
/// - Preview-related flags (`--preview-*`) require `--preview-command`
///
/// This validation prevents creating broken ad-hoc channels that reference non-existent commands.
