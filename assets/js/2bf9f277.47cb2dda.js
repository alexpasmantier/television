This is useful when the remote control is not needed or\n          when the user wants `tv` to run in single-channel mode (e.g. when\n          using it as a file picker for a script or embedding it in a larger\n          application).\n\n      --hide-remote\n          Hide the remote control on startup (only works if feature is enabled).\n          \n          This flag works identically in both channel mode and ad-hoc mode.\n          The remote control remains functional and can be toggled visible later.\n\n      --show-remote\n          Show the remote control on startup (only works if feature is enabled).\n          \n          This flag works identically in both channel mode and ad-hoc mode.\n\n      --no-help-panel\n          Disable the help panel entirely on startup.\n          \n          This flag works identically in both channel mode and ad-hoc mode.\n          When set, no help panel will be shown regardless of channel configuration\n          or help panel-related flags.\n\n      --hide-help-panel\n          Hide the help panel on startup (only works if feature is enabled).\n          \n          This flag works identically in both channel mode and ad-hoc mode.\n          The help panel remains functional and can be toggled visible later.\n\n      --show-help-panel\n          Show the help panel on startup (only works if feature is enabled).\n          \n          This flag works identically in both channel mode and ad-hoc mode.\n          This overrides any channel configuration that might have it disabled.\n\n      --ui-scale <INTEGER>\n          Change the display size in relation to the available area.\n          \n          This flag works identically in both channel mode and ad-hoc mode.\n          \n          This will crop the UI to a centered rectangle of the specified\n          percentage of the available area.\n\n      --height <INTEGER>\n          Height in lines for non-fullscreen mode.\n          \n          This flag works identically in both channel mode and ad-hoc mode.\n          \n          When specified, the picker will be displayed as a non-fullscreen interface.\n\n      --width <INTEGER>\n          Width in columns for non-fullscreen mode.\n          \n          This flag can only be used in combination with --inline or --height.\n          When specified, the picker will be constrained to the specified width.\n\n      --inline\n          Use all available empty space at the bottom of the terminal as an inline interface.\n          \n          This flag works identically in both channel mode and ad-hoc mode.\n          \n          When enabled, the picker will be displayed as an inline interface that uses\n          all available empty space at the bottom of the terminal. If there is insufficient\n          space to meet the minimum height the terminal will scroll.\n\nBehavior:\n  -t, --tick-rate <INT>\n          The application's tick rate.\n          \n          This flag works identically in both channel mode and ad-hoc mode.\n          \n          The tick rate is the number of times the application will update per\n          second. This can be used to control responsiveness and CPU usage on\n          very slow machines or very fast ones but the default should be a good\n          compromise for most users.\n\n      --watch <FLOAT>\n          Watch mode: reload the source command every N seconds.\n          \n          When a channel is specified: Overrides the watch interval defined in the channel prototype.\n          When no channel is specified: Sets the watch interval for the ad-hoc channel.\n          \n          When set to a positive number, the application will automatically\n          reload the source command at the specified interval. This is useful\n          for monitoring changing data sources. Set to 0 to disable (default).\n\n      --autocomplete-prompt <STRING>\n          Try to guess the channel from the provided input prompt.\n          \n          This flag automatically selects channel mode by guessing the appropriate channel.\n          It conflicts with manually specifying a channel since it determines the channel automatically.\n          \n          This can be used to automatically select a channel based on the input\n          prompt by using the `shell_integration` mapping in the configuration\n          file.\n\n      --exact\n          Use substring matching instead of fuzzy matching.\n          \n          This flag works identically in both channel mode and ad-hoc mode.\n          \n          This will use substring matching instead of fuzzy matching when\n          searching for entries. This is useful when the user wants to search for\n          an exact match instead of a fuzzy match e.g. to improve performance.\n\n      --select-1\n          Automatically select and output the first entry if there is only one\n          entry.\n          \n          This flag works identically in both channel mode and ad-hoc mode.\n          \n          Note that most channels stream entries asynchronously which means that\n          knowing if there's only one entry will require waiting for the channel\n          to finish loading first.\n          \n          For most channels and workloads this shouldn't be a problem since the\n          loading times are usually very short and will go unnoticed by the user.\n\n      --take-1\n          Take the first entry from the list after the channel has finished loading.\n          \n          This flag works identically in both channel mode and ad-hoc mode.\n          \n          This will wait for the channel to finish loading all entries and then\n          automatically select and output the first entry. Unlike `select_1`, this\n          will always take the first entry regardless of how many entries are available.\n\n      --take-1-fast\n          Take the first entry from the list as soon as it becomes available.\n          \n          This flag works identically in both channel mode and ad-hoc mode.\n          \n          This will immediately select and output the first entry as soon as it\n          appears in the results, without waiting for the channel to finish loading.\n          This is the fastest option when you just want the first result.\n\nKeybindings:\n  -k, --keybindings <STRING>\n          Keybindings to override the default keybindings.\n          \n          This flag works identically in both channel mode and ad-hoc mode.\n          \n          This can be used to override the default keybindings with a custom subset.\n          The keybindings are specified as a semicolon separated list of keybinding\n          expressions using the configuration file formalism.\n          \n          Example: `tv --keybindings='quit=\"esc\";select_next_entry=[\"down\",\"ctrl-j\"]'`\n\n      --expect <STRING>\n          Keys that can be used to confirm the current selection in addition to the default ones\n          (typically `enter`).\n          \n          When this is set, confirming the selection will first output an extra line with the key\n          that was used to confirm the selection before outputting the selected entry.\n          \n          Example: `tv --expect='ctrl-q'` will output `ctr-q\\n<selected_entry>` when `ctrl-q` is\n          pressed to confirm the selection.\n\nConfiguration:\n      --config-file <PATH>\n          Provide a custom configuration file to use.\n          \n          This flag works identically in both channel mode and ad-hoc mode.\n\n      --cable-dir <PATH>\n          Provide a custom cable directory to use.\n          \n          This flag works identically in both channel mode and ad-hoc mode.\n\nHistory:\n      --global-history\n          Use global history instead of channel-specific history.\n          \n          This flag only works in channel mode.\n          \n          When enabled, history navigation will show entries from all channels.\n          When disabled (default), history navigation is scoped to the current channel.\n"})})}function d(e={}){const{wrapper:n}={...(0,o.R)(),...e.components};return n?(0,a.jsx)(n,{...e,children:(0,a.jsx)(c,{...e})}):c(e)}},8885:(e,n,t)=>{t.d(n,{R:()=>s,x:()=>l});var i=t(9378);const a={},o=i.createContext(a);function s(e){const n=i.useContext(o);return i.useMemo(function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(n):{...n,...e}},[n,e])}function l(e){let n;return n=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(a):e.components||a:s(e.components),i.createElement(o.Provider,{value:n},e.children)}}}]);
